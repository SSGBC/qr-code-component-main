## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

The main thing I have learned on this first project is making good use of online resources. I was getting stuck with how to properly position the qr-code image and was able to find assistance using W3 schools. Going through tutorials makes you feel like everything is easy. Once you have to do it on your own with no hand holding everything you learned flies out the window. I was glad to be able to remember to use online resources that are available.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

The first area I need to continue development in is CSS positioning. I really strugled with getting everything lined up correctly.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me with getting a quick refresher for different CSS aspects and properties I would need assistance with.
